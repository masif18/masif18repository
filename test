HI KANCHAN HONDA,

I BOOK MY SCOOTER ACTIVA 125 PREMIUM MATT GREY ON 03/01/2022 AND SCOOTER SHOWING ME ON 13/01/2022.
SO I PAID FULL AMOUNT SAME DAY 13 JAN 2022. I ALREADY SAID MANAGER ON BOOKING TIME SCOOTER REQUIRED IN URGENT BASIS BUT THEY SAID ONLY ONE LINE " WE DIDN'T COMMITMENT FOR ANY DATE WHEN ALL PROCESS COMPLETE". 

NOW POINT IS TODAY IS 17 JAN 2022 BUT STILL SAME LINE AGAIN REPEATING. 
I WAS VERY UPSET AND REGRETTING MY DECISION TO TAKING ACTIVA 125 PREMIUM TO KANCHANA HONDA SHOWROOM.
NOW MANAGER SAID ANOTHER EXCUSES SO WANTED TO KNOW KANCHAN HONDA WHEN MY BIKE RECEIVE WITH FULL PROCESS COMPLETE.

REGARDS,
MOHAMMAD ASIF
